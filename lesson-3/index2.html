            <h1>Welcome to The Little Saguaro Chamber of Commerce</h1>
            <h2>We are here to hear, advocate, and nurish businesses within our community.</h2>
            <p>Here in The Little Saguaro Chamber of Commerce we primarly seek to inspire and bolster small businesses here in the town of Sahuarita.
                We provide events to hear out businesses and then plan for to best growth that these businesses can achieve which in turn 
                helps our small community here in Southern Arizona to grow and flourish as the cacti of our town's namesake.

            <h2>My Target Audiences</h2>
            <p>My primary audience of my Chamber of Commerce website will be for persons looking to learn more about the local
              Chamber of Commerce. They can learn about its history and location. Then it will have main members that can be contacted and reached out too.
            I also want to provide a list of small businesses that are located in my town of Sahuarita.</p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
                <h5>Bill O'Malley</h5>
                <p>Bill is a local resident of Sahuarita. He is originally from Wisconsin but has moved down here to escape the harsh winters of the north.
                 He is looking to invest in many small businesses in Sahuarita in order to make a small income during retirment.</p>
                
                <h5>Lucia Mendoza</h5>
                <p>Lucia is a 25 year old college graduate from the U of A. She obtained a scholarship and completed her associates through Pima Community college
                and recently finished her bachelors in Business Management. She is looking to fufil her dream of starting a local business that could potentially brach out in the future.</p>
                <p>Lucia is hoping that through the Chamber of Commerce sight, she can find a way to see how the community is towards local businesses and any potential help that she needs
                    such as investors and other people that could help her to have her vision take off.</p>

            <h2>Color scheme</h2>
            <p>I have decided for my color scheme to follow a desert theme to match the enviroment of my town. I want to have a tan background.
                I want to use (#fee9b8) as my background tan. I feel that its not too bright but its also not to dark either and would help 
                give a pop of color to my background.</p>

                <p>I then want to use this reddish brown color (#e04b2d) as the color for bars and tabs on my page. I plan 
                to have white letters in the brown tabs to help with readability.
            </p>

            <p>For my footer bar I think I want to use a green that would represent the cacti that thrive in my town. 
                The green would be (#2E6E41FF). It's a dark green but it has a bit of life in it which represents the cacti well. </p>
