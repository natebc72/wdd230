                <p>In my first section, I would like to discuss white-space and clean design. With any web page, too much clutter would drive anyone crazy.
                    White space or "negative space" is a principal of web design which is empty space around the content and functional elements of a page.
                    By limiting the content and functional elements the page can in a way breathe and help the browsing parties be focused on the necessary elements
                    in the pages design. I chose Google as my example. The main function of Google is to make an internet search. The page maintains
                    a simple design with the logo being large and centralized. Then below it is placed the search bar. This simple and clean
                    design helps focus the browsers (people) towards the intended use of the page.

                <h2>The Rule of Thirds</h2>

                <img src="images/rule-o-3.png" alt="rule">
                <p>The rule of thirds is a rule derived from photography. The rule of thirds is a type of composition in
                which an image is divided evenly into thirds, both horizontally and vertically The subject of the image is placed at the intersection of 
                those dividing lines, or along one of the lines itself. While other ways of photographing may appear appealing, nothing compares to photos
                which follow the rule of thirds. In the example of Carvana, we see the woman is on the left side of the photo. She is along the line
                 of the left third of the photo then the other two-thirds of the photo is open showing</p>

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

            <P>Hicks Law clearly stated is that, the more choices you present your user with the longer they will take to make a desicion.
                 If we think about the old TV remotes and all the buttons we had, we would get frustrated trying to do anything like put on subtitles
                 or adjust the channel. Now a days we see remotes with little buttons. Most of the control buttons are now in the menu section where we can make adjustments there but not have them all over
                 the place on the tv remote. As we look at the example of amazon, we can see clearly the big button to buy the product now. There are a few other buttons that are smaller
                 that give options to save the product or search for other items for sale. This is a great example of Hick's Law to limit the amount of buttons and helps
                 the consumer make a choice on whether or not they want to buy the product.
